    <p>This notice describes the Privacy Policy that applies to all information collected or submitted when you install or use the Bracket Dating application or any of the other proprietary software applications or services we provide, and when you visit our website (all of which are referred to collectively herein as the "Bracket Dating Technologies"). The Bracket Dating Technologies are owned and operated by Bracket Dating, LLC (referred to herein as "we," "us," "our," or "Bracket Dating"), which has developed applications and services for use in connection with a variety of devices and platforms.</p>
    <p>We understand your concerns about privacy. We want you to understand what types of information we collect and what may happen to that information if you install the Bracket Dating  application, visit the Bracket Dating  Website or use any of the Bracket Dating Technologies.</p>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, you should contact us at admin@bracketdatingapp.com.  Alternatively, you may contact us at:</p>

        <li>
            <strong>USER ACCOUNTS AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</strong>
            <p>You are not required to create a user account or provide any personal information in order to visit the Bracket Dating website. You are required to create a user account, however, to use our application. During registration, you are required, through your Facebook account (or manually to the extent such information is not available through your Facebook account), to provide your name, sex, age, occupation, and school.</p>
            <p>We also collect information if you contact us for support or help or otherwise communicate with us. The information which you supply to us enables us to customize and enhance the services we provide to you. In addition, it helps us communicate with you about our news, events, promotions and new products.</p>
            <p>If you choose to use our paid service, our third party payment processors will collect and handle your credit card and related payment information. Such third party processors’ use of your personal information is governed by their respective privacy policies.</p></li>
        <li>
            <strong>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION AS PART OF USING BRACKET DATING  SERVICE</strong>
            <p>Like most web-based services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs when you use the Bracket Dating Technologies. We may use a variety of methods, including clear GIFs (also known as “web beacons”) and “cookies” (small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized services), to collect this information. The information that we collect with these automated methods may include, for example, your IP address, cookie information, a unique device or user ID, browser type, system type, the content and pages that you access, and the “referring URL”. We may also collect your geolocation information.</p>
            <p>We may use passively-collected data to: (i) monitor your participation in various sections of the Bracket Dating Technologies; (ii) customize our service to you; (iii) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (iv) administer, operate, and improve the Bracket Dating Technologies and our other services and systems, and to provide services and content that are tailored to you. If we directly combine any information gathered through passive means with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, we use information collected by passive means in aggregated forms.</p>
            <p>Under California law, website and online service operators are required to disclose how they respond to web browser "do not track" signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information about a consumer’s online activities over time and across third party websites, to the extent the operator engages in that collection. We do not track our users’ personal information over time and across third-party websites and therefore this requirement does not apply to us. California law also requires website and online service operators to disclose whether third parties may collect personal information about their consumer’s online activities over time and across different sites when the consumers use the operator’s website or service. Third parties that have content or services on our Website, such as an analytics service, may obtain information about your browsing or usage habits but this information does not include personal information. We do not knowingly permit such third parties to collect any personal information from the Bracket Dating Technologies unless you directly provide it to us and we provide it to them with your consent.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN</strong>
            <p>We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. The Bracket Dating Technologies are directed to users 18 years of age or older.  We do not knowingly collect any personal information from young people under the age of 18 and if we learn that we have inadvertently done so, we will promptly delete it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>USE OF INFORMATION</strong>
            <p>We use personal information to establish and enhance our relationship with you. We may use personal information (i) to operate, provide, improve, and maintain the Bracket Dating Technologies, (ii) to develop new services, (iii) to prevent abusive and fraudulent use of the  Bracket Dating Technologies, (iv) to personalize and display content on the Bracket Dating Technologies, (v) to send you information about other events or services in which we believe you may be interested, (vi) to verify your identity and conduct appropriate diligence, and (vii) for other administrative and internal business purposes.</p>
            <p>We may use your e-mail address for administrative communications such as communicating with you, notifying you of major Bracket Dating Technologies updates, for customer service purposes, and to send privacy or security-related notices.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>SHARING OF INFORMATION</strong>
            <p>When you register as a user and provide personal information in connection with your registration, we share your personal information with other users of the Bracket Dating Technologies in connection with the services that we provide. Other users will be provided with access to this information in our sole discretion. For example, to the extent you are the "winner" in another user’s daily dating bracket game, we will share your contact information with that user. We do not rent or sell email addresses or other personal information. We do not share personal information with third parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p><strong>Bracket Dating  Service Providers</strong></p>
            <p>We may provide personal information to third parties for their use in performing internal business functions (e.g., payment processing, maintenance, security, email transmission, or data hosting) on our behalf.  Such entities only use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and for no other purpose than to provide us with necessary services.</p>
            <p><strong>Legal Requirements</strong></p>
            <p>We may disclose personal information if we have a good-faith belief that doing so is required by a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order or otherwise required by law. Additionally, we may disclose personal information where we, in good faith, deem it appropriate or necessary to (i) prevent violation of the Bracket Dating  Terms of Use, or our other agreements, (ii) take precautions against liability, (iii) protect the rights, property, or safety of Bracket Dating, any individual, or the general public, (iv) maintain and protect the security and integrity of our services or infrastructure, (v) protect ourselves and our services from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses, (vi) investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations or (vii) assist government enforcement agencies.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>SECURITY</strong>
            <p>We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and/or unauthorized alteration of the information under our control or under the control of our service providers. Your personally identifiable information is protected by utilizing both online and offline security methods, including firewalls, passwords and restricted physical access to the places where your information is stored. Although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain free from security issues. In the event of a security breach involving your personal information, we will make any legally required disclosures to you in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with the legitimate interests of law enforcement, or any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>PHISHING</strong>
            <p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Bracket Dating. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your username, password, credit card information or national identification number in an unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>MANAGING MY PRIVACY SETTINGS</strong>
            <p>You may, at any time, update, correct, or delete certain personal information that you have provided to us by changing such information on the "Settings" section of the Bracket Dating application or by contacting us at admin@bracketdatingapp.com.</p>
            <p>We keep your information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable legal requirements.  Please be aware that even if you update or remove personal information that you have provided to us, your personal information may be retained in our backup files and archives for a reasonable period of time for legal purposes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>AMENDMENTS TO POLICY</strong>
            <p>Please note this Privacy Policy will change from time to time. We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on our website or through the Bracket Dating  application. All amended terms shall automatically be effective thirty (30) days after they are initially posted on the website. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy that affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our website notifying users that our Privacy Policy has changed. Our use of your information shall be governed by the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy in effect when you first use our application or thirty (30) after the terms are changed, as explained above.</p>
