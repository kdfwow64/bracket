            <strong>INDEMNIFICATION</strong>
            <p>You agree, at your own expense, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Bracket Dating, LLC, its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees, agents, distributors and licensees, from and against any judgments, losses, deficiencies, damages, liabilities, costs, claims, demands, suits, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert witness fees and expenses) incurred in, arising out of or in any way related to your breach of this Agreement, your use of the Bracket Dating Technologies, or any of your other acts or omissions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>DISPUTES</strong>
            <p>
                <strong>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any of the Bracket Dating Technologies will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.  The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.  An arbitrator, however, may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including, without limitation, injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms of Service as a court would.  Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court, and allows for more limited discovery than in court.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>To initiate an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to:  Manager, Bracket Dating, LLC,  2633 McKinney Ave., Ste 130-172
Dallas, TX 75204.  The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.  The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.  Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules.  We will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fees, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees.  Unless you and we agree otherwise, any arbitration will take place in the county (or parish) where you live.  If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.  We will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claims are frivolous.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.</strong>  The arbitrator will decide all issues, including, without limitation, issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement.  If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, <strong>we each waive any right to a jury trial.</strong>
            </p>

        <li>
            <strong>GOVERNING LAW</strong>
